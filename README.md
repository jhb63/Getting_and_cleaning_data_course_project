This directory contains the following items:

README.md, provides context and instructions for how the run_analysis.R, was created
tidy_data.txt, data set.
CodeBook.md, variables in the dataset (data, variables and transformations used to generate the data).
run_analysis.R, the R script that was used to create the data output 

Downloads and unzips source data from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip.
Loads data.

1.Merge the training and the test sets to create one data table.
2.Extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3.Use descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.
4.Appropriately label the data set with descriptive variable names.
5.Create a second, independent tidy set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

Write the data set to the tidy_data.txt file.
